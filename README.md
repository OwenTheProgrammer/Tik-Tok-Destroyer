# Tik-Tok-Destroyer

# Description
Do you hate seeing your family and friends on Tik Tok? Same here, so I built a Chrome extension to redirect you to the bible because they need jesus.

# Original Video
This project was made for [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27Q3EF_dOxQ&ab_channel=OwenTheProgrammer) on [My Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBN7kAz6Rbso4d97u3BYK2w)

# Installation
1. Download this project as a ZIP
2. Extract the folder and enter the Tik-Tok-Destroyer-Main folder in the extracted folder
3. Open Google and go to chrome://extensions/
4. Turn on Developer mode
5. Click "Load unpacked"
6. Open the TikTokDestroyer folder in Tik-Tok-Destroyer-Main/Tik-Tok-Destroyer-Main/TikTokDestroyer\
You have just installed Tik Tok Destroyer. Feel free to turn off developer mode if you want.

# Usage
After installing, the chrome extension should work automatically, redirecting any link that starts with the domain "www.tiktok.com" and replacing any text fields containing "TikTok" with "A Bad App"

# License BS
All files in this project can be used in any way and redistribution is fine by me. I would appreciate credit to this github link though!
